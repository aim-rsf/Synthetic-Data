 ## Inventory of synthetic datasets

Data providers are creating synthetic versions of their datasets, for various different purposes. Below we list some synthetic datasets related to health research (not an exhaustive list, just some key examples).

**Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)**

- CPRD offer 4 synthetic datasets[^1] based on their two separate primary care databases, Aurum and GOLD[^2].
- A data license agreement must be completed, in order to access these synthetic datasets. 
- The four datasets:
  - *CPRD cardiovascular disease synthetic dataset* based on CPRD Aurum database (high fidelity) - a small cost
  - *CPRD COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors synthetic dataset* based on CPRD Aurum database (high fidelity) - a small cost
  - *CPRD Aurum sample dataset* based on CPRD Aurum database (medium fidelity) - free!
  - *CPRD GOLD sample dataset* based on CPRD GOLD database (medium fidelity) - free!

**UK Biobank**
- UK Biobank[^4] offer one low fidelity dataset[^3], at similar size and structure to the real dataset, with values generated at random.
- There appears to be no cost for this dataset, and it can be downloaded from the website directly.

**NHS**
- The NHSE Data Science Case Studies[^5] offer code & methods to generate synthetic data.
- NHS Digital ran an Artificial data pilot[^6], creating three synthetic datasets based on Hospital Episode Statistics (from NHS Hospitals across England).
- NHS England share a synthetic version of A&E data[^7]
- There appears to be no cost for these datasets, and they can be downloaded from the websites directly.
